# LAB-4-Cryptarithmetic-with-CSP
Solve cryptarithmetic puzzles by modeling them as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP).

Description
This activity must be developed in the pre-assigned teams of two.

Using the updated csp (constraint-satisfaction problem) module developed and descriped in chapter 3 of [KOPEC], write a Python script called cryptarithmetic_puzzle.py that solves cryptarithmetic puzzles involving addition of two or more addends. It is highly recommended that you reread this chapter of the book to make sure you have an adequate understanding of the algorithm being used.
